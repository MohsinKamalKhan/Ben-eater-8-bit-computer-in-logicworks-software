When you open the cct file in LogicWorks, the fibbonacci program will already be loaded into RAM ( RAM on second circuit ). Run the Clock the off the CLEAR
state to see the fibbonacci numbers on the decimal counter. I have tried to organize the computer in their corrosponding components, so if you want to look
deeper into components double click to edit them.
I have also provided the PersonalLibrary.clf library, so you can use all the components used in other circuits ( move the clf file into Libs folder inside 
LogicWorks folder ). 
There is also a simple python program to translate the asm code into hex which you can copy and paste inside RAM ( select RAM then go to Simulation > RAM Wizard
and then edit ). 
I have also provided a cpp file as there is space to more instructions in computer. So if you want you can add more instructions, and then generate their 
microcodes using the cpp program.
